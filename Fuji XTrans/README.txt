Included:
Fuji XTrans III - Acros

Usage:

The simulations are designed to be applied to a neutral RAW file, this means no auto-levels or custom tone curves / contrast should be applied, although you can still use the exposure slider to correct initial brightness.  Any processing to the image should ideally happen AFTER you've applied the simulation or you may get unintended results.
